**I need an image evaluated for its suitability as a visual representation of a Chinese Modern Poem.** Please analyze the poem first, focusing on identifying its key elements, semantics (meaning and interpretation), and core message.

The Chinese Modern Poem is as follows:
title: {poemTitle}
body: {poemBody}

Once you have analyzed the poem, evaluate the following image {imgURL} using these criteria:

1. Appropriateness Check (MUST PASS ALL):

- No excessive disturbing/creepy elements
- All major elements of the image must resemble elements in real life (e.g., a person cannot have 3 arms)
- No excessive violence or gore
- No inappropriate content
- Age-appropriate (suitable for as young as 13 years old)
- {{Add any additional appropriateness checks specific to the poem's theme}}
If ANY appropriateness check fails, immediately mark for regeneration.

2. Core Message (MUST PASS ALL):

- Does the image capture the primary emotion or feeling conveyed in the poem? (e.g., joy, sorrow, peace, anger, longing, etc.)
- Does the image reflect the central theme(s) of the poem? (e.g., love, loss, nature, social justice, identity, etc.)
- Does the image accurately represent any key metaphors, symbols, or allegories used in the poem?
- Does the image convey the overall tone or mood of the poem? (e.g., serious, humorous, optimistic, pessimistic, contemplative, etc.)
- If the poem tells a story or depicts a scene, does the image accurately represent that narrative or setting?
- {{Add any additional core message checks specific to the poem's theme}}
If ANY core message check fails, immediately mark for regeneration.

3. Additional Metrics (Must Pass at Least 2 of 3):

- Key Elements: Does the image visually represent the key elements identified in the poem (e.g., specific objects, characters, settings)?
- Semantic Representation: Does the image accurately convey the meaning and themes of the poem through its visual elements?
- Technical Quality: Is the image well-composed, visually appealing, and free of technical flaws? (Consider aspects like lighting, color, detail, and overall artistic style).

Explanation: [Provide specific issues or successful elements for each metric. Be detailed in your reasoning.]

The last line must be: "Regenerate: YES/NO"
